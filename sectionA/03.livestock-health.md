Create a detailed Livestock Health Plan for an animal husbandry operation. The plan should include the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the importance of livestock health and the purpose of the plan. Specify the type of livestock (e.g., cattle, sheep, poultry) and the size of the operation (e.g., small-scale, commercial).

2. **Health Monitoring Protocols**: Outline procedures for regular health checks, including frequency (e.g., daily, weekly), signs of illness to monitor (e.g., lethargy, reduced feed intake), and record-keeping methods.

3. **Vaccination and Preventive Care**: List recommended vaccinations and preventive treatments (e.g., deworming, parasite control) specific to the livestock type. Include schedules and administration methods.

4. **Nutrition and Feeding**: Describe a balanced nutrition plan to support immune health, including feed types, supplements, and water quality management.

5. **Biosecurity Measures**: Detail practices to prevent disease introduction and spread, such as quarantine protocols, visitor restrictions, and sanitation procedures for equipment and facilities.

6. **Emergency Response Plan**: Provide steps for handling disease outbreaks or injuries, including contact information for veterinarians, isolation procedures, and treatment protocols.

7. **Training and Staff Responsibilities**: Specify training requirements for farm workers on health monitoring, biosecurity, and emergency response, including roles and responsibilities.

8. **Review and Updates**: Explain how the plan will be reviewed and updated (e.g., annually, after disease incidents) to ensure ongoing effectiveness.

Ensure the plan is practical, evidence-based, and tailored to the specified livestock type. Use clear, concise language suitable for farm managers and workers. Include sample schedules or checklists where relevant.
