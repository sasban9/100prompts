Write a detailed technical report on satellite design for an aerospace engineering audience. The report should cover the following key sections:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the satellite's purpose, mission objectives, and its role in the context of modern space applications (e.g., communication, Earth observation, scientific research). Specify the type of satellite (e.g., CubeSat, geostationary, LEO) and its intended orbit.

2. **System Requirements**: Outline the functional and performance requirements, including payload capacity, power needs, communication bandwidth, and lifespan. Address environmental constraints such as radiation, thermal extremes, and vacuum conditions.

3. **Design Architecture**: Describe the satellite's subsystems in detail, including:
   - **Structure**: Materials, mass, and structural integrity for launch and orbital conditions.
   - **Power System**: Solar panels, batteries, and power management for continuous operation.
   - **Thermal Control**: Active and passive thermal management strategies to maintain optimal operating temperatures.
   - **Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)**: Sensors and actuators (e.g., reaction wheels, magnetorquers) for precise orientation and stabilization.
   - **Propulsion**: Type of propulsion (if any) for orbit maintenance or deorbiting.
   - **Communication System**: Antennas, transceivers, and data rates for ground station interaction.
   - **Payload**: Instruments or equipment specific to the mission (e.g., cameras, spectrometers).
   - **Onboard Data Processing**: Computing hardware and software for data handling and autonomy.

4. **Design Trade-offs and Analysis**: Discuss key design decisions, such as cost versus performance, reliability versus complexity, or mass versus capability. Include quantitative analyses, such as link budgets for communication or power budgets for energy management.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Explain the testing procedures to ensure the satellite meets mission requirements, including environmental testing (vibration, thermal vacuum, radiation) and subsystem integration tests.

6. **Launch and Operations**: Describe the launch vehicle compatibility, deployment mechanisms, and operational strategies, including ground segment interaction and end-of-life disposal plans to comply with space debris mitigation guidelines.

7. **Conclusion**: Summarize the designâ€™s strengths, potential challenges, and alignment with mission objectives. Highlight innovations or unique features of the design.

8. **References**: Cite relevant aerospace engineering standards (e.g., ECSS, NASA guidelines), peer-reviewed papers, or industry reports to support your design choices.

The report should be written in a formal, technical tone, with clear section headings and subheadings. Use diagrams, tables, or charts where appropriate to illustrate subsystem designs, trade-off analyses, or performance metrics. Ensure the content is concise yet comprehensive, targeting a length of 10-15 pages (approximately 3,000-5,000 words). Assume the audience consists of aerospace engineers, mission planners, and project managers familiar with satellite systems.
